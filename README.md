# React100-Change-Calculator

![](images/ProjectScreenshot.png)

One of my first few React projects in the React100 course at San Diego Code School and the very first 
time to be challenged with the "make it look like this" direction. Not wanting to use bootstrap or knowing 
how to implement CSS at the time the project was entirely styled with  inline attributes, hey I did my best..
haha. The project is integrated with two inputs, one for money owed and one for money paid to calculate both 
the total change due and denominations for the payout. 

Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps.. 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start (which will build and run on local server 3000)
4. Open up your browser to view on localhost 3000

Thank you, Miles Mickelson
